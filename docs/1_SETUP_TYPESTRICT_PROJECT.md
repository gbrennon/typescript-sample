# Task 1: Setup TypeScript as strict project

## Summary of Changes
- Created `src/index.ts` with a sample TypeScript function.
- Configured `tsconfig.json` to enable strict mode and set `outDir` to `dist` and `rootDir` to `src`.
- Installed TypeScript as a dev dependency using `npm install --save-dev typescript`.
- Compiled the TypeScript project to generate JavaScript files in the `dist` directory.

## Files Added/Modified
- Added `src/index.ts`
- Added `tsconfig.json`
- Modified `.gitignore` file (already existing from previous steps)
